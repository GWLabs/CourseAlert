# GWCourseAlert

### Summary

To optimize students' time and help them register more smoothly for courses, this registration alert system will give students a platform to set up alerts about classes. The system goals will be the following:

1. Easy interface to set alert by entering CRN and email
2. Alert for OPEN, CLOSED, and WAITLIST status
3. Pull course catalog for alerts every hour
4. Recommendations for other classes when one becomes full
